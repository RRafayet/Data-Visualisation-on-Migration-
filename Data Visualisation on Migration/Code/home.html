            Welcome to our migration visualization project, where we dive deep into the fascinating topic of migration within the context of Australia.

             Our Australian map serves as a canvas, illustrating the flow of individuals into various states and territories, showcasing the ebb and flow of migration over time.
             Not only do we present the influx of people into different states, but we also delve into the departure trends.
            
             In addition to visualizing the overall migration trends, we provide insights into the various visa classes that individuals have utilized to enter different states.
